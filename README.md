# Juan-s-PDF-Merger
Simple program for merging PDF files, preserving the pages as they are.

This program is on its first version. I developed it as I was looking for choices to merge PDF files with hyperlinks where the text
did not match with the link. After trying with different programs, I could not find any one which solved this issue. I found one but
it placed a watermark on every page, it was time consuming removing them, and with the program I had originally, then the hyperlinks
were lost.

I created this program after several times I used Python for merging my PDF files. It was better to create a GUI for doing this task.
